responsive-12
=============

A lightweight css framework for Responsive,  Mobile-Friendly Web interfaces.

The Contentrex responsive12 CSS Framework is a minimal solution to a sleek and
powerful boilerplate for mobile-first based websites.
The core component is not comparable to the big CSS Framekorks
such as bootstrap, Foundation or Yaml. It should rather provide a sleek well-understand
framework for responsive webpages.
